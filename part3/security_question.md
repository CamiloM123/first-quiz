## Solution: System Security

1. **Employee Education**:
   - Start by educating our employees in good security practices to cultivate a strong security culture within the company.

2. **Infrastructure Security** (Aligned with OWASP Top 10):
   - **Broken Access Control**: Ensure proper configuration and enforcement of access control policies, allowing employees access only to the resources necessary for their roles. Regularly audit access controls.
   - **Cryptographic Failures**: Review and ensure the quality and up-to-date use of encryption algorithms to prevent vulnerabilities arising from insecure communication protocols.
   - **Injection Attacks**: Detect and prevent injection vulnerabilities, including SQL and NoSQL injections. Implement input validation and prepared statements to mitigate risks.
   - **Insecure Design**: Identify and rectify design flaws that could lead to vulnerabilities. Utilize threat modeling, secure design patterns, and principles to enhance security.
   - **Security Misconfiguration**: Strengthen system security through a hardening process and segment components to isolate vulnerabilities. Apply multi-layered security policies.
   - **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**: Focus on component security, keep components updated, and consider DevSecOps practices for continuous monitoring and security.
   - **Identification and Authentication Failures**: Securely manage authentication mechanisms, consider multi-factor authentication, and validate user roles for resource access.
   - **Software and Data Integrity Failures**: Verify software and data integrity by implementing checks and procedures for software updates and critical data.
   - **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: Expand logging and monitoring capabilities to detect various failure types. Ensure data backup and availability.
   - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Perform targeted testing to identify and mitigate potential SSRF vulnerabilities. Implement network and application-level defense controls.
